Why are there four different CR2 files?
=======================================

Antonia comes with two different UV mappings and in two different
resolutions. The 'A' mapping (AntoniaA and AntoniaA-lo) is the
original mapping made by me (odf). The new mapping (Antonia and
Antonia-lo) was made by Renderosity member MikeJ and is cut more
conventionally. There are free textures available for both mappings,
so if you load a texture and it does not fit, be sure to try it with
the other mapping. In other words, if you've loaded AntoniaA or
AntoniaA-lo, try Antonia or Antonia-lo, and vice versa.

What are the relative scaling factors of the UV maps?
=====================================================

(This question will not concern you unless you make textures.)

The scaling factors for the 'A' mapping are as follows:

1 x for body and feet
2 x for hands and skull
4 x for the nails and everything on the face map
4 x vertical and 10 x horizontal for the genitals

I have no idea about the other mapping.
